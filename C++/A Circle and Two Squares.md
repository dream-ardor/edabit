## A Circle and Two Squares

Imagine a circle and two squares: a smaller and a bigger one. For the smaller one, the circle is a circumcircle and for the bigger one, an incircle.


Create a function, that takes an integer (radius of the circle) and returns the difference of the areas of the two squares.
```c++
Examples
squareAreasDifference(5) ➞ 50

squareAreasDifference(6) ➞ 72

squareAreasDifference(7) ➞ 98
```
### 🟤 ▪️ ▪️ My Code
```c++
#define squareAreasDifference(r) 2 * r * r
```
