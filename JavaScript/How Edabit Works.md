## How Edabit Works

This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab you'll see a starter function that looks like this:
```js
function hello() {

}
```
All you have to do is type return "hello edabit.com" between the curly braces and click the Check button. If everything went according to plan, the button will turn red and say SUBMIT FINAL. Click it and see what happens.

## My Code
```js
function hello() {
	return "hello edabit.com";
}
```
