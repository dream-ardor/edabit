## Derivative of a Function

Create a function that takes numbers b and m as arguments and returns the derivative of the function f(x)=x^b with respect to x evaluated at x=m, where b and m are constants.
```
Examples
derivative(1, 4) âžž 1

derivative(3, -2) âžž 12

derivative(4, -3) âžž -108
```
### ðŸ”°  My Code
```js
const derivative = (b, m) => b * m ** (b - 1);
```
