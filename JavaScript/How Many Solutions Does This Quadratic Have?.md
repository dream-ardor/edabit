## How Many Solutions Does This Quadratic Have?

A quadratic equation a xÂ² + b x + c = 0 has either 0, 1, or 2 distinct solutions for real values of x. Given a, b and c, you should return the number of solutions to the equation.
```js
Examples
solutions(1, 0, -1) âžž 2
// xÂ² - 1 = 0 has two solutions (x = 1 and x = -1).

solutions(1, 0, 0) âžž 1
// xÂ² = 0 has one solution (x = 0).

solutions(1, 0, 1) âžž 0
// xÂ² + 1 = 0 has no real solutions.
```
### ðŸŒ” My Code
```js
const solutions = (a, b, c, d = b * b - 4 * a * c) => d ? d > 0 ? 2 : 0 : 1;

```
