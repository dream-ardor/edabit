## Come Check Out This Crazy Function

You are given a function with two numbers, a and b. You are also given an output that shows the result of an expression that manipulates the two numbers to get to the output. What you are supposed to do is return what that expression is. I am not going to tell you what the expression is because that will spoil the fun! :)
