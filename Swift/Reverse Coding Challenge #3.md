## Reverse Coding Challenge #3

This is a reverse coding challenge. Normally you're given explicit directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produce the sample outputs shown.
```
Examples
[5, 7, 8, 2, 1], 2 âžž [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

[9, 8, 16, 47], 4 âžž [1, 0, 0, 3]

[17, 11, 99, 55, 23, 1], 5 âžž [2, 1, 4, 0, 3, 1]

[6, 1], 7 âžž [6, 1]

[3, 2, 9], 3 âžž [0, 2, 0]
```
### ðŸŒ² My Code
```swift
let mysteryFunc = {(a:[Int], b:Int) in a.map {$0 % b}}
```
