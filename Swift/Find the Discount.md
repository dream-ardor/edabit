## Find the Discount

Create a function that takes two arguments: the original price and the discount percentage as integers and returns the final price after the discount.
```swift


Examples
discount(1500, 50) ➞ 750

discount(89, 20) ➞ 71.2

discount(100, 75) ➞ 25
```
### 🏦 My Code
```swift
let discount:(Double, Double) -> Double = {$0 * (100 - $1) / 100}

or

let discount = {(p:Double, d:Double) in p * ( 100 - d) / 100}
```
