## Find Out the Leap Year

A leap year happens every four years, so it's a year that is perfectly divisible by four. However, if the year is a multiple of 100 (1800, 1900, etc), the year must be divisible by 400.

Write a function that determines if the year is a leap year or not.
```swift
Examples
leapYear(2020) âžž true

leapYear(2021) âžž false

leapYear(1968) âžž true
```
### ðŸ“† My Code
```swift
let leapYear = {$0 % 4 == 0 && $0 % 100 != 0}
```
