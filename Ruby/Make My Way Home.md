## Make My Way Home

You will be given an array, showing how far James travels away from his home for each day. He may choose to travel towards or away from his house, so negative values are to be expected.

Create a function that calculates what distance James must walk to get back home.
```ruby
Examples
distance_home([2, 4, 2, 5]) âžž 13

distance_home([-1, -4, -3, -2]) âžž 10

distance_home([3, 4, -5, -2]) âžž 0
```
### ðŸ’Ž My Code
```ruby
def distance_home(a)
  a.inject(:+).abs
end
```
