## Primitive Darts Game

Darts is a target game played by throwing feathered darts at a circular board with numbered spaces. Our darts game is the simplest of all games. The score of a single turn is calculated based on the distance from the middle. You need to create a function that takes the dart location as two cartesian coordinates (x, y) and returns a score based on the distance from the middle, aka Bullseye (x=0, y=0).
```
Bullseye and inner circle scores = 10 points
Middle ring scores = 5 points
Outer ring scores = 1 point
Outside the target = 0 points
We play it simple so a dart in the double or treble ring counts as usual and does not affect the segment score.

Board and circle radius is as follows:

Board radius and outer circle radius = 10 units
Middle circle radius = 5 units
Inner circle radius = 1 unit
Short Description
Convert cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (R, phi) and return the score based on the R value. R > 10 gives 0 points, 10 >= R > 5 gives 1 point, 5 >= R > 1 gives 5 points, R <= 1 gives 10 points.

Examples
darts_scoring(0, 0) âžž 10

darts_scoring(3, 2) âžž 5

darts_scoring(0, -0.8) âžž 10
```
### ðŸ’Ž My Code
```ruby
def darts_scoring(x, y)
  a = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
  a > 10 ? 0 : a > 5 ? 1 : a > 1 ? 5 : 10	
end
```
