## Keyboard Mistakes

Character recognition software often makes mistakes when documents (especially old ones written with a typewriter) are digitized.

Your task is to correct the errors in the digitized text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:
```ruby
A is misinterpreted as 4
S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

Examples
keyboard_mistakes("MUB45H1R") âžž "MUBASHIR"

keyboard_mistakes("DUBL1N") âžž "DUBLIN"

keyboard_mistakes("51NG4P0RE") âžž "SINGAPORE"
```
### ðŸ’Ž My Code
```ruby
def keyboard_mistakes(s)
  s.tr('4501','ASOI')
end
```
