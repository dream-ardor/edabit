## Arithmetic Progression

In mathematics, an Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. Create a function that takes three arguments:

The first element of the sequence first
Constant difference between the elements diff
Total numbers in the sequence n
Return the first n elements of the sequence with the given common difference diff. Final result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.
```ruby
Examples
arithmetic_progression(1, 2, 5) âžž "1, 3, 5, 7, 9"

arithmetic_progression(1, 0, 5) âžž "1, 1, 1, 1, 1"

arithmetic_progression(1, -3, 10) âžž "1, -2, -5, -8, -11, -14, -17, -20, -23, -26"
```
### ðŸ“¤ My Code
```ruby
def arithmetic_progression(s, d, n)
  s.step(by:d).first(n).join(', ')
end
```
