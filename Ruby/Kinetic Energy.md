## Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy can be calculated with the following formula:
```
KE = 1/2mvÂ²

m is mass in kg
v is velocity in m/s
KE is kinetic energy in J
Return the Kinetic Energy in Joules, given the mass and velocity. For the purposes of this challenge, round answers to the nearest integer.

Examples
calc_kinetic_energy(60, 3) âžž 270

calc_kinetic_energy(45, 10) âžž 2250
```
### ðŸ’Ž My Code
```ruby
def calc_kinetic_energy(m,v)
  (m * v * v/2).round
end
```
