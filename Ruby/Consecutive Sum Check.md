## Consecutive Sum Check

Create a function that takes a number n as an argument and checks whether the given number can be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers.
```
Examples
consecutiveSum(9) ➞ true
# 9 can be expressed as a sum of (2 + 3 + 4) or (4 + 5).

consecutiveSum(10) ➞ true
# 10 can be expressed as a sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.
```
### 💎 My Code
```ruby
def consecutive_sum(n)
  (n & (n - 1)) != 0
end
```
