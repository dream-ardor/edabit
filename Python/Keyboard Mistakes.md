## Keyboard Mistakes

Character recognition software often makes mistakes when documents (especially old ones written with a typewriter) are digitized.

Your task is to correct the errors in the digitized text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:
```
A is misinterpreted as 4
S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1

The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

Examples
keyboard_mistakes("MUB45H1R") ➞ "MUBASHIR"

keyboard_mistakes("DUBL1N") ➞ "DUBLIN"

keyboard_mistakes("51NG4P0RE") ➞ "SINGAPORE"
```
### :snake: My Code
```python
def keyboard_mistakes(t):
  return t.translate(t.maketrans('0145','OIAS'))
```
